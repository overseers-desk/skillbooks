## Execution model

Spawn a **Sonnet subagent** to run the workflow. Profile DOM dumps are 1–2 MB; search responses are a few KB. Tell the subagent to use the scripts in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/instagram.com/` — do not paste scripts inline.

## Prerequisites

A logged-in Instagram session in the user-data-dir that `not-google-chrome` targets.

Note: `--lang` flags do not override Instagram's locale; it is a server-side account setting. The parsers are locale-agnostic, so this does not matter.

If a request redirects to `/accounts/login/` or returns empty JSON, the session has expired or been rate-limited. Stop and let the user log in interactively; continuing usually makes it worse.

## Skill-specific Chrome-compatible flag

The wrapper handles standard flags (headless, window size, user agent, user-data-dir, flock, timeout). This skill appends `--virtual-time-budget=N` (4000 for search, 6000 for profile) to give Instagram's JSON endpoint time to hydrate. Save stdout and stderr separately: a common pitfall is `2>/dev/null > out.html` producing a zero-byte file; `> out.html 2> out.err` is reliable.

## DM read-state policy

Before invoking any DM-content script (§9, and any future script whose filename carries `mark-seen`, `mutate-seen`, or `send`), name the specific thread(s) about to be touched and surface the read-state implication to the user, then wait for an explicit yes. For §9 the implication to surface is: this will only return content for threads already opened in the user's Instagram client; the script refuses unread threads and will not mark anything seen on the user's behalf.

§5 (`inbox-noninvasive.tcl`) is exempt — it reads inbox metadata only, never thread content, and blocks seen-mutation requests at the Fetch layer.

The internal refusal gate inside §9 is a backstop. A run without prior disclosure violates the policy even if the script would have refused anyway.

## 1. Search via the topsearch JSON endpoint

Instagram's rendered search page (`/explore/search/keyword/?q=...`) is GraphQL-hydrated and stays empty in a headless dump within a reasonable time budget. The internal endpoint `/web/search/topsearch/?query=...`, authenticated, returns clean JSON directly. Use that:

```bash
not-google-chrome -t 30 \
  "https://www.instagram.com/web/search/topsearch/?query=SEARCH_TERMS" \
  --virtual-time-budget=4000 \
  > /tmp/instagram-search.html 2> /tmp/instagram-search.err
```

URL-encode search terms (spaces become `%20`).

The response contains `users[]`, `hashtags[]`, and `places[]`. Each user includes `username`, `full_name`, `is_verified`, `is_private`, and (where applicable) `social_context` listing mutual followers — useful signal for disambiguation.

## 2. Parse search results

```bash
tclsh ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/instagram.com/parse-search.tcl /tmp/instagram-search.html
```

Prints a ranked list of candidate handles with display name, verified/private flags, profile URL, and mutual-followers context.

## 3. Fetch a profile

```bash
not-google-chrome -t 45 \
  "https://www.instagram.com/HANDLE/" \
  --virtual-time-budget=6000 \
  > /tmp/instagram-profile.html 2> /tmp/instagram-profile.err
```

Instagram has no separate "about" page on the web.

## 4. Parse profile

```bash
tclsh ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/instagram.com/parse-profile.tcl /tmp/instagram-profile.html
```

Reliably extracts (from `<meta>` tags, which are server-rendered):
- Handle and canonical URL (from `og:url`)
- Display name (from `og:title`)
- Follower / following / post counts — parsed positionally so locale-agnostic
- Avatar URL (from `og:image`)
- A snippet of the most recent post's caption (from `meta name=description`)

When available (typically only for the logged-in user's own profile or profiles the viewer already follows closely), the parser also pulls JSON-hydrated fields: `biography`, `external_url`, `category_name`, `is_verified`, `is_private`, and exact counts. For most third-party profiles these JSON fields are absent — the og:description counts are the source of truth.

## 5. DM inbox metadata (noninvasive)

This script reads inbox metadata only. It must not be modified to read individual thread content. If you need message content from a specific thread, that is a separate, invasive operation. Write a different script with a different name.

```bash
not-google-chrome --cdp -- tclsh ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/instagram.com/inbox-noninvasive.tcl list
```

Emits JSON with one entry per thread: `username`, `full_name`, `thread_id`, `last_activity_iso`, `last_snippet` (up to 120 chars of the last message text or a type label), `unseen` (boolean), `is_group`.

To verify the script does not mutate read state:

```bash
not-google-chrome --cdp -- tclsh ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/instagram.com/inbox-noninvasive.tcl verify-noninvasive
```

Runs `list` twice with a 45-second sleep, diffs the `unseen` field per thread, exits 0 if stable and exits 2 if any thread flipped from unseen to seen.

Requires a logged-in session. Does not navigate to `/direct/inbox/` to avoid triggering a "user is viewing inbox" presence beacon. Any outgoing request matching seen-mutation URL patterns (`*/seen/*`, `*/mark_seen*`, `*item_seen*`, `*direct_thread*` POST) is blocked at the Fetch domain level and logged to stderr.

## 6. Recent posts for a handle

```bash
not-google-chrome --cdp -- tclsh ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/instagram.com/fetch-recent-posts.tcl posts HANDLE
not-google-chrome --cdp -- tclsh ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/instagram.com/fetch-recent-posts.tcl posts HANDLE --limit 50
not-google-chrome --cdp -- tclsh ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/instagram.com/fetch-recent-posts.tcl posts HANDLE --raw-out /path/raw.json
```

Default limit is 12. Pagination via the feed API's `next_max_id` cursor happens automatically when `--limit` exceeds 12. The script navigates to the profile page once to resolve the user_id (from inline JSON or the `web_profile_info` API), then calls `/api/v1/feed/user/<user_id>/` directly in a loop until the limit is reached or `more_available` is false.

`--raw-out PATH` (off by default) also writes the unparsed raw feed-API items (the full per-post objects, ~130 fields each) to PATH before parsing. Use it when a caller wants to keep the whole response and re-derive fields later without re-fetching; stdout stays the parsed form.

Each post entry includes:

- `post_id`, `shortcode`, `url`, `post_type` (image/video/carousel/reel), `taken_at_iso`
- `like_count`, `comment_count`, `play_count`, `ig_play_count`, `fb_play_count`, `view_count`, `media_repost_count`, `fb_like_count`, `fb_comment_count` (play/view/reshare null on stills; the `fb_*` are null unless the post was cross-posted to Facebook)
- `video_duration` (seconds, null on stills), `like_and_view_counts_disabled` (the creator hid metrics)
- `caption`, `hashtags` (regex-extracted from caption), `mentions` (regex-extracted from caption)
- `tagged_users` (the "tag people" feature on the post; aggregated across carousel slides)
- `coauthors` (the dual-author collab-post feature)
- `sponsors` (branded-content sponsor tags)
- `is_paid_partnership`, `location`

The five handle-bearing fields above (`mentions`, `tagged_users`, `coauthors`, `sponsors`, plus paid-partnership context) are what the collab-expansion script in §7 walks to find candidates.

## 7. Collab partner expansion (multi-handle spider)

```bash
not-google-chrome --cdp -- tclsh ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/instagram.com/collab-expand.tcl expand handle1,handle2,handle3
not-google-chrome --cdp -- tclsh ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/instagram.com/collab-expand.tcl expand --from /tmp/seeds.txt --posts-per-handle 36
```

Walks a list of input handles, fetches recent posts for each (paginated via §6's helpers), and accumulates the union of `tagged_users`, `coauthors`, `sponsors`, and caption `mentions` across all posts. Outputs candidate handles NOT already in the input set, ranked by explicit-collab signal first (tagged + coauthor + sponsor counts) and then by caption-mention count and breadth of source handles.

Each candidate row carries the four per-signal counts, a `total`, and a sorted `sources` list of input handles whose posts surfaced the candidate. Multi-source candidates (handles surfaced by several different input accounts) rank higher than single-source ones at equal signal strength.

This is single-level expansion. For "spider" behaviour (recursively expanding), feed the top N candidates as input to a second run.

Default `--posts-per-handle` is 24 (about two pages). Pacing: roughly one feed page every 2 seconds, plus a 2-second gap between input handles. A run over 5 input handles at 24 posts each takes about a minute.

## 8. Post comments (for comment-circle discovery)

```bash
not-google-chrome --cdp -- tclsh ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/instagram.com/fetch-post-comments.tcl comments SHORTCODE
not-google-chrome --cdp -- tclsh ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/instagram.com/fetch-post-comments.tcl comments POST_ID
```

Accepts a shortcode (e.g. `DXsPrn5AvNH`), a full post_id from the feed API (`<media_id>_<user_id>`), or a bare numeric `media_id`. Shortcode-to-media-id conversion is a local base64 decode, so no extra fetch is needed to resolve. Calls `/api/v1/media/<media_id>/comments/` via fetch() inside the authenticated session.

Returns first-page comments only (typically 20-50, occasionally 1-2 if the post is lightly engaged or moderated). The first page is most-recent and has the highest signal for creator-on-creator engagement; older comments add noise. Pagination via `min_id` cursor can be added later if comment-circle yield proves insufficient.

Each comment row carries the four free significance signals:

- `is_verified` — Instagram's platinum-tier flag. Catches public-figure-tier accounts. Misses the meaty mid-tier creator case where neither party is verified.
- `has_default_avatar` — `true` when the user has not uploaded a profile picture (heuristic; checks for known default-avatar URL fragments and the API's `has_anonymous_profile_picture` flag). Throwaway accounts almost always have a default avatar.
- `text_length_words` — word count of the comment. A creator engaging another creator usually writes more than one word; a fan drops "❤️🔥".
- `comment_like_count` — likes on the comment itself. Weak but free signal.

Plus `username`, `full_name`, `text`, `created_at`, `comment_id`.

Workflow: comment-circle discovery promotes a commenter handle to a sweep candidate only if at least one of (`is_verified`, `text_length_words >= 3`, `has_default_avatar == false`) holds. This drops 80 to 95 percent of typical commenter sets before any profile fetch happens. Surviving handles enter the standard sweep pipeline (parse-profile then fetch-recent-posts), so the per-commenter profile fetch is just sweep doing its normal work, not a dedicated enumeration job. Instagram does not distinguish the request pattern.

The `comment_count_total` field in the response is the live count from this endpoint, which can differ from the cached count in the feed API. Treat the comments endpoint as authoritative.

## 9. DM thread history reader (seen threads only)

```bash
not-google-chrome --cdp -- tclsh ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/instagram.com/read-seen-thread.tcl thread <thread_id> [--limit N]
not-google-chrome --cdp -- tclsh ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/instagram.com/read-seen-thread.tcl by-handle <handle>   [--limit N]
not-google-chrome --cdp -- tclsh ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/instagram.com/read-seen-thread.tcl all-seen             [--limit N]
```

Fetches message history from a DM thread for P-phase use. Companion to §5: §5 enumerates inbox metadata without ever touching thread content; §9 reads thread content but only for threads the operator has already marked seen. The hyphen-delimited word "seen" in the filename is load-bearing, parallel to "noninvasive" in §5.

The seen-only guarantee is enforced by calling the same `/api/v1/direct_v2/inbox/` endpoint §5 uses to check the thread's unread status BEFORE issuing any thread-content fetch. If `marked_as_unread` is true OR the viewer's `last_seen_at[viewer_id].timestamp` is older than `last_activity_at`, the script refuses with a structured error and never makes the thread-content call. The defensive `Fetch.enable` block list for seen-mutation URL patterns is also armed.

Per-message output includes `is_from_viewer` (whether the message is from the operator's side or the other party), `timestamp_iso`, normalised `text` (with bracketed type labels for `[shared post]`, `[reel-share]`, `[action]`, `[media]`, `[link]`, `[disappearing media]`, etc.), `item_type`, and `item_id`.

Verified 2026-05-12 against the live inbox: refusal path correctly skipped a thread carrying `marked_as_unread: true`; success path returned 9 messages across both directions from a seen thread. After both runs, the previously-unread thread was confirmed still unread by re-running §5, proving the gate did not leak a thread-content fetch onto the refused thread.

`all-seen` is the batch primitive for P: enumerate every thread in the current inbox, return parsed messages for the seen ones, and emit a separate `refused` list noting which threads were skipped and why. Useful when profiling many contacts in one pass.

## 10. Followers / following list extractor

```bash
not-google-chrome --cdp -- tclsh ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/instagram.com/fetch-followers.tcl followers HANDLE [--limit N] [--csv PATH]
not-google-chrome --cdp -- tclsh ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/instagram.com/fetch-followers.tcl following HANDLE [--limit N] [--csv PATH]
```

Enumerates `/api/v1/friendships/<user_id>/followers/` or `/.../following/` via fetch() inside an authenticated CDP session. Resolves handle → user_id by reusing `resolve_user_id` from §6, then paginates the cursor-based endpoint (25 users per page, `next_max_id`) until `--limit` is reached or the endpoint reports no more pages.

Default `--limit` is 500. Without `--csv`, the script prints JSON with a `users` array; with `--csv PATH` it writes one row per user to that path and omits the array from stdout (the stdout JSON still carries `handle`, `user_id`, `kind`, `count_returned`, `limit_requested`, `stop_reason`, and `csv_path`).

Per-entry fields:

- `user_id`, `username`, `full_name`
- `is_verified`, `is_private`
- `has_default_avatar` (same heuristic as §8 — known default-avatar URL fragments plus the API's `has_anonymous_profile_picture` flag)
- `profile_pic_url`

The five non-URL fields mirror the §8 comment-row shape, so the same sweep pre-filter (verified OR not-default-avatar OR ...) applies if the friendships output is fed into the standard sweep pipeline.

**Visibility and accuracy:**

- Private profiles return 0 users unless the logged-in viewer follows them. No workaround.
- The header counts shown by §4 (parsed from og:description) are server-cached and frequently drift a few percent from the enumerable list. Treat the friendships endpoint as authoritative for the list itself; treat the header count as authoritative only for "roughly how many."
- Order is reverse-chronological by relationship creation, not alphabetical or by engagement.

**Pacing and limits:** The friendships endpoint is one of the most aggressively throttled in IG's web API. The script paces ~2.5 seconds per page, which a small profile (a few hundred entries) absorbs cleanly. For larger profiles, expect soft-throttling (truncated pages, 429s, or "challenge_required") somewhere in the low thousands of entries per session. If `stop_reason` comes back as `error:HTTP 4xx` partway through, back off and re-run later — do not hammer.

`stop_reason` values: `limit` (hit the `--limit` cap), `exhausted` (endpoint returned no more pages), or `error:<detail>` (HTTP failure, often throttling).

Verified 2026-05-19 against `@_a.j.handyman_`: header counts 162 followers / 188 following; enumerated 162 followers (full match) and 182 following (6-entry gap, consistent with cached-header drift). Both lists written to CSV cleanly across 7-8 pages each.

## 11. Tag-reshare compliance audit

Built for SOP D40 (Social Media Reply) §6: the service team must reshare customer-tagged stories and posts to the brand's own story. This script audits which tags since `--since` were not reshared.

```bash
not-google-chrome --cdp -- python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/instagram.com/audit-tag-reshares.py \
    audit historicrivermill --since 2026-05-01
```

Add `--debug` on the first run to dump raw API responses to `/tmp/instagram-audit-*.json`. The reshare-match heuristic (which inspects `reshared_reel.id`, `imported_taken_at`, and `reel_mentions[].user_id`) is best-effort and may need adjustment once real fields are inspected.

What the script pulls:

- **Tagged feed posts** — `/api/v1/usertags/<user_id>/feed/`, paginated until items predate `--since`. Permanent data, full coverage.
- **Activity-inbox story-mention notifications** — `/api/v1/news/inbox/`, filtered to story-mention rows. Instagram retains these for roughly 14-30 days only; older story tags are unrecoverable.
- **Currently-live story tray** — `/api/v1/feed/user/<user_id>/story/`, for stories posted in the last 24h.
- **Own story archive** — `/api/v1/archive/reel/day_shells/` + `seen_media`, walked back to `--since`. Only readable if the logged-in viewer IS the target account. If the viewer is a different account, the script reports `archive_not_accessible` in `coverage` and lists the implication in `notes`.

Reshare matching: for each tag (post or story), the script looks for a target-side story that either (a) carries a `reshared_media_id` equal to the tag's media id, or (b) has a `reel_mentions` entry pointing at the tag's actor within 24 hours of the tag timestamp.

Output is a JSON object with `summary` (counts), `missed_post_reshares`, `missed_story_tags`, `matched_*` lists, a `coverage` block (per source), and a `notes` array listing every applicable caveat. Always read `notes` and `coverage` before quoting a count — the same audit run can give very different numbers depending on whether the archive was reachable.

Operational notes:

- For a complete historical audit, the user must log in as the brand account in Chromium before running. A personal-account session can only see live (<24h) stories on the brand side.
- To build an ongoing audit trail, schedule the script daily and append the output to a log. Combined with the activity-inbox retention window, this captures every story tag before Instagram drops the notification.
- The script does not write or modify any Instagram state. All endpoints are read-only fetches.

## What this skill does NOT do (by design)

- It does not scrape individual post captions in bulk by opening each permalink. Recent post captions arrive via the feed API in §6; for older posts beyond pagination depth, a permalink fetch would be needed.
- It does not handle hashtag or place pages, only people search and profiles. The topsearch endpoint already returns hashtags and places for discovery; dedicated pages would be a separate addition.
- It does not attempt to defeat rate limits or checkpoints. Pace requests, a few per minute, not a burst.
