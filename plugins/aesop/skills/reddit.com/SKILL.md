## Why this skill exists

WebFetch hard-refuses reddit.com ("Claude Code is unable to fetch from www.reddit.com"), so the only path to Reddit content is the headless-browser wrapper. Reddit's rendered HTML is auto-translated into the logged-in account's UI locale, which corrupts verbatim quote capture; its `.json` endpoints carry original-language text and parse cleanly. This skill fetches the `.json` endpoint through the wrapper and parses it.

## Execution model

Spawn a **Sonnet subagent** to run the workflow. A search dump is tens of KB; a busy thread can be a few hundred KB. Tell the subagent to use `not-google-chrome` (the wrapper from the headless-browser skill, called by bare name), the parser at `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/reddit.com/reddit.tcl`, and the discussion batcher at `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/reddit.com/reddit-discussions.tcl`. Keep raw dumps out of the main session.

A Reddit search hit is always a **post** (submission, kind `t3`); there is no comment-level search. A post's `comments/<id>.json` endpoint returns the post body and the comment tree together, so "go to the post" and "go to the comments" are a single fetch. §1-2 are the two-step path (one fetch, then parse a file); §3 collapses search-then-read-each into one browser session and is what you usually want for gathering discussions.

## Prerequisites

`[browser] user_agent` set in `$HOME/.claude/skills/config.ini` (the wrapper exits 78 without it). Reddit's public `.json` does not require a logged-in session, but going through the user's Chromium profile keeps the fingerprint consistent and reduces throttling. If a dump comes back as a "blocked" or login interstitial, back off rather than hammer; Reddit throttles bursts.

## 1. Search

Subreddit search:

```bash
not-google-chrome -t 25 \
  "https://old.reddit.com/r/SUBREDDIT/search.json?q=SEARCH+TERMS&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all&limit=25" \
  > /tmp/reddit-search.html 2> /tmp/reddit-search.err
```

Site-wide search (drop `restrict_sr`):

```bash
not-google-chrome -t 25 \
  "https://old.reddit.com/search.json?q=SEARCH+TERMS&sort=relevance&t=all&limit=25" \
  > /tmp/reddit-search.html 2> /tmp/reddit-search.err
```

URL-encode the query (spaces as `+` or `%20`). `sort` accepts `relevance`, `new`, `top`, `comments`; `t` (time) accepts `all`, `year`, `month`, `week`, `day`. Save stdout and stderr separately: `2>/dev/null > out` produces a zero-byte file on some shells.

Parse:

```bash
tclsh ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/reddit.com/reddit.tcl search /tmp/reddit-search.html --limit 25
```

Prints, per post: title, `r/subreddit`, `u/author`, score, comment count, date, the full `old.reddit.com` permalink, and a 200-char selftext snippet. Take the permalink of a promising post into step 2.

## 2. Read a post and its comments

Append `.json` to any post permalink. A `www.reddit.com/r/SUB/comments/ID/slug/` URL works the same way; swap the host to `old.reddit.com` for locale consistency or leave it, since the `.json` body is original-language regardless:

```bash
not-google-chrome -t 25 \
  "https://old.reddit.com/r/SUBREDDIT/comments/POST_ID.json?limit=100&sort=top" \
  > /tmp/reddit-thread.html 2> /tmp/reddit-thread.err
```

Parse:

```bash
tclsh ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/reddit.com/reddit.tcl thread /tmp/reddit-thread.html --limit 50
```

Prints the post header (title, subreddit, author, score, comment count, date, permalink), the full selftext, then the comment tree indented by depth, each comment carrying `u/author`, score, date, and body. `--limit` caps the number of comments emitted. Reddit collapses deep threads behind "load more" stubs; the first `.json` page covers the top of the tree, which is the highest-signal part for quote gathering.

## 3. Return whole discussions for a search (one browser pass)

Searches, then fetches each result's discussion (post body plus comment tree) over a single CDP session, so it does not pay a browser cold-start per result. This is the usual entry point for quote-gathering.

```bash
not-google-chrome --cdp -- tclsh ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/reddit.com/reddit-discussions.tcl \
  --query "SEARCH TERMS" [--subreddit SUB] \
  [--sort relevance|new|top|comments] [--time all|year|month|week|day] \
  [--limit 5] [--comments 15]
```

Subreddit listing instead of a search (omit `--query`, give `--subreddit`; `--sort` then takes `hot|new|top|rising`):

```bash
not-google-chrome --cdp -- tclsh ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/reddit.com/reddit-discussions.tcl \
  --subreddit SUB --sort hot --limit 5 --comments 15
```

`--limit` is the number of discussions returned; `--comments` caps comments printed per discussion. Each discussion prints the post header, full selftext, and the top comment tree, the same format as §2. The script reads `CDP_WS_URL` from the wrapper's `--cdp` environment; it exits 78 if run without it. It paces one second between discussions.

## 4. List the logged-in account's saved items

The saved listing is private: Reddit returns it only to the account that owns it, so this needs the user's session cookie. It runs over CDP (the authenticated `old.reddit.com` origin), the same path §3 uses, and **the user must close their GUI Chromium first** (the user-data-dir lock, see CLAUDE.md), otherwise the headless instance reads no cookies and Reddit answers `404`.

```bash
not-google-chrome --cdp -- tclsh ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/reddit.com/reddit-saved.tcl \
  --user NAME [--limit 25]
```

`--user` is the account whose saved list to read and must be the logged-in account; another user's saved list is unreachable. `--limit` is the number of items returned, newest first. The script walks Reddit's `after` cursor across pages internally (100 per fetch, paced one second apart), so the caller asks for a count and never handles a cursor. A saved list interleaves posts (`t3`) and comments (`t1`); both print, comments tagged `[comment]` and carrying the title of the post they sit under. A `404` here means not logged in, the wrong account, or the GUI browser is still holding the profile lock.

## Notes

- The parser strips the wrapper's `<pre>`, unescapes the HTML-render layer and Reddit's own entity escaping, and parses the result as JSON. It also accepts a raw `.json` body if fetched some other way. The §3 batcher fetches JSON directly via in-page `fetch()`, so there is no `<pre>` layer there; the shared `clean` still handles Reddit's entity escaping.
- A post-only Listing parses with `search` mode, so a subreddit front page (`/r/SUB/.json`) or a user's posts (`/user/NAME.json`) work through the same command. A saved listing mixes posts and comments, so it has its own `saved` mode (`reddit.tcl saved <dump>`), which §4 calls.
- Author may read `[deleted]`; score may be hidden (shown as the number Reddit returns, often a low placeholder) on recent posts. These are Reddit states, not parse errors.

## What this skill does NOT do

- It does not post, vote, comment, or message. Read-only.
- It does not paginate a comment tree past the first page or expand "load more" stubs (§2, §3). Add a `more`-children walk if deep threads prove necessary. Saved-item listings (§4) do paginate, by following the Listing `after` cursor.
- It does not defeat rate limits. Pace requests; a few per minute, not a burst.
