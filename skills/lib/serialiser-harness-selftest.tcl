# serialiser-harness-selftest.tcl - offline check of the harness's site
# confinement (the optional 4th serialiser::run argument) and the SiteOf fold.
#
# No browser: a fake cdp::Client stands in, with a redirect map so a nav can
# land somewhere other than where it was pointed, the silent-rebase drift the
# confinement exists to catch. Pacing is zeroed for the runs because the fold
# and the confinement decisions are under test here, not the cadence. The tiny
# probe skills are written to a scratch directory at runtime and removed on
# success (left in place on a failure, for inspection).
#
#   tclsh serialiser-harness-selftest.tcl

# Exits non-zero on the first mismatch; prints PASS per case otherwise.
