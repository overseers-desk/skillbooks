# serialiser-harness.tcl - the policing harness behind browser-serialiser.
#
# A browser skill no longer opens its own CDP socket. Instead the harness loads
# the skill into a per-run SAFE interpreter (Tcl Safe Base) and exposes a fixed
# POLICED COMMAND SURFACE: a skill calls verbs like `nav`, `eval`, `api`, `emit`;
# each verb runs back in the MASTER interpreter, where the harness drives the
# real browser through cdp-client.tcl and enforces web-behaviour policy. The
# skill never reaches a socket, a file, exec, or raw CDP.
#
# Two enforcement planes (the plan's Shape C):
#   Plane 1 (capability): ::safe::interpCreate removes file/exec/socket/raw-CDP.
#       The skill's own directory and skills/lib are added to the safe interp's
#       access path so a skill may `source` its shared siblings (e.g. the other
#       Instagram scripts source fetch-recent-posts.tcl as a library) and the
#       harness verb definitions, but nothing else on the filesystem is reachable.
#   Plane 2 (web behaviour): the harness paces and jitters the wire-touching
#       verbs, enforces view-before-fetch for declared private endpoints, bounds
#       response/paging size, classifies 429 / login-wall outcomes into
#       terminal states the skill reads through `state` but cannot retry past,
#       and, when the hosting runner grants a lease site, confines every
#       landing and api site to it (terminal `off-site` on a breach).
#
# This file is the SAME library both execution hosts use. `browser-serialiser`
# (standalone) sources it and calls serialiser::run; a later overseer host will
# embed it and call serialiser::run on its leased browser. Everything host-
# specific (who owns the browser) is behind serialiser::Session, so the policy
# and the command surface live in one place.
#
# Command surface and entry convention: skills/serialised-browsing/COMMAND-SURFACE.md.
